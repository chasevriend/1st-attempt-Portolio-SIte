                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>I have always been a creative person. Growing up, I loved and used drawing as an outlet to share my creativity with those around me.
                        I always dreamt of being a graphic desginer or an artist of some sort. The idea of exercising creativity has always excited me.
                        During high school I used to mess around with html pages in my free time. Little did I know I was beginning my career as a front 
                        end developer. I attended college for some time then decided to leave and chase my passion. Web development is now my creative outlet and 
                        I'm excited to share my work and have it provide value to the world.
